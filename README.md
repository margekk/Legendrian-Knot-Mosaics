Tools for working with Legendrian knot mosaics, as described in [placeholder for upcoming paper]. `mosaic_gen.rs` can be used to generate all suitably connected Legendrian knot mosaics of a given size, which can then be cataloged by `mosaic_cat.py`. 

`to_image.py` can be used to convert the Legendrian mosaic codes used in these programs into images.
